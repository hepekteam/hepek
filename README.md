### HepekOS ###
An operating system in batch, with everything from an e-mail client to a text editor :)
Basically uses external tools to expand it's capabilities, but still stays in the regular batch
OS style. This is NOT a script kiddie, but a project made by 2 guys, to show how batch can be
used to make wonderful programs, all you need to know is what to use and how to use it :)

This project was worked on since 2012 and was halted 3 times... (The HepekOS phase, The Hepek Light Phase and the Hepek Enhanced Phase)
This is the full version, usable for non-commercial videos and personal use. You may request a Free (Commercial) license, or
by donating (and linking your mail in the description) you will get a link where you will play a game that
determines which license you will get (link is usable only once :) )

Please do not remove the hepek_recovery folder as it contains vital files to restore a corrupted install.
If you want to, you can download a ?????_LIGHT build that only contains the downloader and the necessary packages
to execute the Hepek Installer.

Thank you for downloading HepekOS!

Cheers,
the Hepek Team
